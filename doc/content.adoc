== Introduction

A structural validation library for Clojure and ClojureScript.


=== Project Maturity

Since _struct_ is a young project there may be some API breakage.


=== Install

Just include that in your depencency vector on *_project.clj_*:

[source,clojure]
----
[funcool/struct "0.1.0"]
----


== User guide

=== Quick Start

Let's require the main _struct_ namespace:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[struct.core :as st])
----

Define a small schema for the example purpose:

[source, clojure]
----
(def +scheme+
  {:name [st/required st/string]
   :year [st/required st/number]})
----

You can observe that it consists in a simple map when you declare keys and
corresponding validators for that key. A vector as value allows us to put
more than one validator for the same key. If you have only one validator for the
key, you can omit the vector and put it as single value.

By default, all validators are optional so if the value is missing, no error
will reported. If you want make the value mandatory, you should use a specific
`required` validator.

And finally, start validating your data:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> {:name "Blood of Elves" :year 1994}
    (st/validate +scheme+))
;; => [nil {:name "Blood of Elves" :year 1994}]

(-> {:name "Blood of Elves" :year "1994"}
    (st/validate +scheme+))
;; => [{:year ("must be a number")} {:name "Blood of Elves", :year "1994"}]

(-> {:year "1994"}
    (st/validate +scheme+))
;; => [{:name ("this field is mandatory"), :year ("must be a number")} {}]
----

If only want to know if some data is valid or not, you can use the `valid?` predicate
for that purpose:

[source, clojure]
----
(st/valid? {:year "1994"} +scheme+)
;; => false
----


=== Parametrized validators

Additionally to simple validators, other may require additional parameters
(e.g. `in-range`). This is how them can be passed to the validator:

[source, clojure]
----
(def schema {:num [[st/in-range 10 20]]})

(st/validate {:num 21} schema)
;; => [{:num ("not in range")} {}]

(st/validate {:num 19} schema)
;; => [nil {:num 19}]
----

Note the double vector, the outer denotes a list of validatiors and the inner
denotes a validator with patameters.


=== Custom messages

The builtin validators comes with default messages in human readable format, but
sometimes you may want to change them (e.g. for i18n purposes). This is how you
can do it:

[source, clojure]
----
(def schema
  {:num [[st/in-range 10 20 :message "errors.not-in-range"]]})

(st/validate {:num 21} schema)
;; => [{:num ("errors.not-in-range")} {}]
----

=== Data coersions

Additionally to simple validation process, this library includes the facility
for coerce values and a collection of validators that matches over strings. Let
see some code:

.Example attaching custom coersions
[source, clojure]
----
(def schema
  {:year [[st/integer :coerce str]]})

(st/validate {:year 1994} schema))
;; => [nil {:year "1994"}]
----

From previous example, you can see that the data returned from the validation
process, the value is properly coerced with the specified coersion function.

Furthermore, this library comes with a collection of validators that already
has attached coersion function, and them serves just for validate paraeters
that comes in string format and convert later to the appropriate type:

[source, clojure]
----
(def schema {:year [st/required st/integer-like]
             :id [st/required st/uuid-like]})

(st/validate {:year "1994"
              :id "543e7472-6624-4cb5-b65e-f3c341843d0f"}
             schema)
;; => [nil {:year 1994, :id #uuid "543e7472-6624-4cb5-b65e-f3c341843d0f"}]
----

For facilitate this operation, it there `validate!` function that receives the
data and scheme and returns the resulting data. If data not matches the schema
an exception will be raised using `ex-info` clojure facility:

[source, clojure]
----
(st/validate! {:year "1994" :id "543e7472-6624-4cb5-b65e-f3c341843d0f"} schema)
;; => {:year 1994, :id #uuid "543e7472-6624-4cb5-b65e-f3c341843d0f"}
----
